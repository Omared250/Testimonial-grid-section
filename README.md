# Testimonial-grid-section
This project is created from a challenge that you can find on the front-end mentor page, it can help you a lot to practice the skills you acquire by focusing on the front-end.

## Description
This project is going to use the GRID function of CSS and practice your skill in this language. The idea of the project is that you try to recreate a section of testimonies in 
this case of some students and that it can not only be seen well on a pc but also on a mobile
